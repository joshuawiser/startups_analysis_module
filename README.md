# Overview

This is a program that takes datasets (in this case it is curated to a data set relating to start-up companies) and creates linear regression graphs using that input data.

# Development Environment

I used R-Studio to develop this, using the R coding language and ggplot.

# Useful Websites

- [R Documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/)
- [CRAN R Project](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html)

# Future Work

- Do testing on more datasets to see how versatile this program could be.
- Include other statistical graphs that go along with the linear regression and add context.
- Create an applet where you can simply upload a csv file and it returns the information.
